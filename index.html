<h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
<p>I have a passion for painting and loves to play with colours using my imagination.
   and Chess has always been my favorite mental exercise. It all started with my mother teaching me the game.
   I still remember my first win against her when i was in 4th and all the jumps and joys of that sweet win. 
   i have revieved may awards of that in school and college.
